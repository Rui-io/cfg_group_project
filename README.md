This project investigates the potential impact of Covid-related news outlets by leading newspapers (The New York Times and The Guardian) on the stock market of leading vaccine providers from the UK and US (Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca). In particular, it seeks to answer the following research question:

Â·   	Can Covid-related news sentiment and occurrence explain positive or negative trends in the stock market prices of the three pharmaceutical companies?

The project could provide useful insight to be deployed in the finance, media and healthcare fields as it seeks to understand the influence news has on the stock market of core pharmaceutical companies and hence, indirectly, on healthcare financing. The present report provides a brief overview of the background to our research, sets out steps specifications, illustrates implementation and execution and describes the development methodology followed by the team. It concludes presenting challenges and discussing the project results.
